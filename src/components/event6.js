            With the theme <b>'Only One Earth'</b> which focuses on living
            sustainably in harmony with nature, NSS NIT Jamshedpur celebrated
            <b>World Environment Day</b> with a motive to restore our
            biodiversity on 5th June. As our campus is full of greenery, we
            cleaned the area and properly watered the plants to provide them
            with a good atmosphere to grow. All the volunteers performed
            different tasks such as planting trees, cleaning plastic products,
            removing weeds, installing a small water container on trees for
            birds, and a lot of other things very enthusiastically. There were
            about 100+ volunteers who became part of our initiative to bring
            positive change.
