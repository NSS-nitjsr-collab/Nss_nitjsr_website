            On the occasion of world bicycle day, the volunteers of NSS NIT
            Jamshedpur took it upon themselves to raise the awareness of
            bicycling. The volunteers took the bicycles and appreciated the
            benefits of the bicycle. Keeping in mind the perks, we hope you
            choose to use a cycle to cover a short distance. <br></br> <br></br>
            Every year June 3rd is recognized as World Bicycle Day. This day is
            to appreciate the flexibility and uniqueness of a bicycle. It will
            also help with one's health, improving your balance and posture,
            cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, strength, and overall mood.
            Let us take a step forward to a healthy and environmental- friendly
            future.
