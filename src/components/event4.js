            The goal of the 'Run for Unity' was to motivate and inspire young
            individuals to run for a great leader who was instrumental in
            uniting India following independence. Such gatherings are held to
            demonstrate unity and solidarity among people of various religions,
            as well as to instil feelings of national integration and
            brotherhood among them.
